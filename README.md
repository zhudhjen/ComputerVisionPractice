# Computer Vision Practice
Python practices about computer vision

### Peoject 1: Harris Detector
Perform corner detection on images. Implement the Harris detector and the Hessian detector and compare their output.

### Project 2: KMeans Visual Words
Use SIFT to get features of image and use K-Means to cluster features and classify images by content

### Project 3: Segmentation: Mean Shift
Use mean shift algorithm to compute the segmentation of an image. Compare the result with the N-Cut algorithm
